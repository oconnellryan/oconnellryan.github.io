## NBA Ticket Pricing Analysis

As my capstone project for the NBA Future Analytics Stars Program, I developed a predictive model for Chase Center ticket prices.  Using two seasons of Golden State Warriors ticket sales data (provided by the NBA) along with additional external game data, I identified key factors influencing ticket demand and pricing. My project was selected as a finalist in the programâ€™s capstone competition.


## Result Highlights
The following graphic showcases the predicted ticket prices for each seat in an individual game scaling from highest (red) to the lowest priced tickets (green): &nbsp;<br>

## Exploratory Analysis
### External Game Factors
**Opponent:** &nbsp;<br>
Playing big market teams and opponents that win more both lead to higher average ticket prices: &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

**Weekday:** &nbsp;<br>
Saturday games have the highest prices on average, but there are no other clear trends here: &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

**Star Player Impact:** &nbsp;<br>
Steph Curry missed 15 games in 2022, and we can see the average ticket prices dropped quickly when he was out: &nbsp;<br>

<img src="/assets/nba/curry_22.png" alt="Image" width="130" style="vertical-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>


He did not miss as many games in 2023, but again these games had lower prices: &nbsp;<br>

<img src="/assets/nba/curry_23.png" alt="Image" width="130" style="vertical-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;<br>

**Gametime:** &nbsp;<br>
Most games were played at 7:00 local time. 25 games were played earlier (almost all at 5:30), and the earlier games had lower average ticket prices: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/new_times.png" alt="Image" width="230" style="horizontal-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>


&nbsp;<br>

**Time of Purchase:** &nbsp;<br>
Tickets are more expensive when purchased further out from games. There is a sharp decrease in the price of gameday tickets: &nbsp;<br>

### Stadium Areas
The following sections were deduced with the data provided: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/new_group.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> 
<img src="/assets/nba/new_group_avgs.png" alt="Image" width="130" style="vertical-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>

**Bowl:** &nbsp;<br>
The bowl of the arena was broken down into further sections based on location and club access: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/new_sections.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> 
<img src="/assets/nba/new_sec_avgs.png" alt="Image" width="130" style="vertical-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>

**Courtside & Floor:** &nbsp;<br>
The floor was split up by side of the court: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/cs_areas_map.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> 
<img src="/assets/nba/curry_23.png" alt="Image" width="130" style="vertical-align: center;"/> &nbsp;<br>


### Seat Features
**Row:** &nbsp;<br>
As expected, the average ticket price decreases as you go back in rows: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/row_avgs_graph.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> &nbsp;<br>
This is especially true in the lower bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/lb_rows_graph.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> &nbsp;<br>
The row trend is not as strong in the upper bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/ub_rows.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> &nbsp;<br>

**Front Row Views (FRV):** &nbsp;<br>
Many non-row 1 seats overhang tunnels or entrances and have no seats in front of them. I labeled these seats as front row views (Example below of seats overhanging the player tunnel): &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/frv.jpg" alt="Image" width="600"/> &nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

**Wheelchair Access (WCA) Areas:** &nbsp;<br>
There are WCA (wheelchair access) areas in the arena. These seats are located in the back of sections in the lower bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/lb_wca_graph.png" alt="Graph" width="560"/>
  
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-left: 10px;">
    <span>View from seat:</span>
    <img src="/assets/nba/wca_lb_view.jpg" alt="Image" width="180"/>
  </div>
</div>

The WCA sections in the upper bowl are located in front of or in the middle of sections: &nbsp;<br>
There are WCA (wheelchair access) areas in the arena. These seats are located in the back of sections in the lower bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/ub_wca_map.png" alt="Graph" width="560"/>
  
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-left: 10px;">
    <span>View from seat:</span>
    <img src="/assets/nba/wca_ub_view.jpg" alt="Image" width="180"/>
  </div>
</div>


&nbsp;<br>

**Graphs of New Rows Created:** &nbsp;<br>
The front row view seats appear to have a premium while the WCA seats are not very expensive in the lower bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/lb_rows_graph2.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> 
The front row view seats have an average price around the same as row 1 seats in the upper bowl. The upper bowl WCA seats have the highest average prices in the upper bowl: &nbsp;<br>
<img src="/assets/nba/ub_rows2.png" alt="Image" width="600"/> 

&nbsp;<br>

## Modeling:
Three models were created to model the ticket prices for entire stadium based on the areas broken down earlier. Many of the predictors were the same for each model, but each one was adjusted for the factors relevant in its area.
### Lower Bowl Model:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/lb_model.png" alt="Image" width="400" style="margin-right: 20px;"/>

  <div>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Sideline club tickets are much more expensive, while general 100 tickets are slightly more expensive than the Pepsi club</li>
      <li>Tickets closer to the center of the court are much more expensive</li>
      <li>Tickets prices drop around $6 every row you go back</li>
      <li>Row 1 tickets are predicted $100 more espensive than  the seat directly behind them</li>
      <li>Front row view seats (not row 1) are predicted $50 more than the seat directly behind them</li>
      <li>Wheelchair areas are the cheapest seats in the lower bowl</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

&nbsp;<br>

The following graph shows predicted lower bowl prices for a specific game:

&nbsp;<br>

### Upper Bowl Model:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/ub_model.png" alt="Image" width="400" style="margin-right: 20px;"/>

  <div>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>Upper behind seats are cheaper than upper bowl and upper premium</li>
      <li>Predicted prices decrease as you go closer to the corners of the arena</li>
      <li>Ticket prices drop around $2 every row you go back</li>
      <li>Row 1 seats are predicted to be roughly $11 more than the seat directly behind them</li>
      <li>Front row view seats (not row 1) are predicted $15 more than the seat directly behind them</li>
      <li>Unlike the lower bowl, wheelchair access sections contain the most expensive upper bowl seats</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Courtside:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/cs_model.png" alt="Image" width="400" style="margin-right: 20px;"/>

  <div>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>True front row seats are predicted to be worth roughly $1800 more than the seat directly behind them/li>
      <li>Predicted prices drop around $600 when going from row BB (true row 2) to A1 (the section behind)</li>
      <li>Tickets in the middle are more expensive (unless sitting behind the baskets)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

&nbsp;<br>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="/assets/nba/cs_model.png" alt="Image" width="400" style="margin-right: 20px;"/>

  <div>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li>True front row seats are predicted to be worth roughly $1800 more than the seat directly behind them</li>
      <li>Predicted prices drop around $600 when going from row BB (true row 2) to A1 (the section behind)</li>
      <li>Tickets in the middle are more expensive (unless sitting behind the baskets)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Key takeaways:
- True front row seats are predicted to be worth roughly $1800 more than the seat directly behind them
- Predicted prices drop around $600 when going from row BB (true row 2) to A1 (the section behind)
- Tickets in the middle are more expensive (unless sitting behind the baskets)


All three models back up the earlier findings regarding external game factors:
- Better & big market opponents lead to higher prices
- Prices are higher in games where Steph Curry plays
- Friday & Saturday games are the most expensive
- Tickets get cheaper as an event approaches
