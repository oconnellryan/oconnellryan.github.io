title: NBA Ticket Pricing
---
In this project I created a predictive model of NBA ticket prices. 2 seasosns of Warriors ticket sales data as well as external game data including opponents and injuries were used for this analysis.


### Exploratory Analysis
Opponents Matter. Playing big market teams and a higher opponent winning percentage both lead to higher average ticket prices:

Steph Curry missed 2 games in 2022, and we can see the average ticket prices dropped quickly when Curry misses games.
